Question)
Why Java known to be a Platform Independent language.
Solution-
Java is a Platform Independent language because it is Java Virtual Machine which maqkes it Platform Independent language.

Java Virtual Machine or we can saimply called it as JVM itself is plateform dependent.

Now going in depth we can explain it as when we first write the code First javaC compiles our written code 

in bytecode.Now this bytecode is not undestandable code and only JVM can convert it in machine understandable language.

But we can run this compiled code or byte code on any OS wether we use Linux or windows or mack for writing it.

Hence we can say that Java is a Platform Independent language.
